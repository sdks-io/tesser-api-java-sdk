You must provide credentials in the client as shown in the following code snippet.

```java
import app.zuplo.tesserplatformv1pull51me98e48a7.TesserAPIV1Client;
import app.zuplo.tesserplatformv1pull51me98e48a7.authentication.BearerAuthModel;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TesserAPIV1Client client = new TesserAPIV1Client.Builder()
            .bearerAuthCredentials(new BearerAuthModel.Builder(
                    "AccessToken"
                )
                .build())
            .build();
    }
}
```
